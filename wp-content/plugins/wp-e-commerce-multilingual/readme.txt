== Description ==

This plugin handles all the little details required to run WP E-Commerce together with WPML, to produce complete e-commerce sites with WordPress.

To run, you will need to install [WPEC](http://getshopped.org/) 3.8.7 and above and [WPML](http://wpml.org) 2.4.1 and above.

= New! Customize your e-commerce site using Types and Views =

WP E-Commerce uses custom post types for products and categories. Now, you can customize your e-commerce site without coding using [Types - The Custom Types and Custom Fields Plugin](http://wp-types.com/home/types-manage-post-types-taxonomy-and-custom-fields/) and [Views - The Custom Content Display Plugin](http://wp-types.com/). Types and Views allow you to achieve a completely unique look for your site without coding. The two plugins are fully compatible with WP E-Commerce and WPML.

* The versions of WP E-Commerce, WPML and WordPress that you're using.
* A URL to your site, where we can see the problem happening.
